# üöó Used Vehicle Data Explorer

https://used-vehicle-data-explorer.onrender.com

## Overview
This project showcases a deployed web application that explores trends in used vehicle sales. It was developed to practice common software engineering tasks‚Äîsuch as building a web interface, performing exploratory data analysis (EDA), and deploying a data app to the cloud.

Users can interactively filter vehicles by year and manufacturer to visualize odometer and price trends, helping uncover factors that influence used car pricing.

Features
- üîç Filter by Year & Manufacturer: Dynamic multi-select options to narrow down the dataset.
- üìä Interactive Visualizations: Explore odometer and price distributions, average prices by model, and more.
- ‚öôÔ∏è Responsive Web App: Built using Streamlit and deployed to the Render cloud platform.
- üåê Publicly Accessible: Easily shareable with recruiters or collaborators.


## Technologies Used

- **Python**: Core logic and data processing  
- **Pandas**: Data manipulation  
- **Plotly Express**: Interactive data visualizations  
- **Streamlit**: Web app framework  
- **Render**: Cloud deployment platform

## How to Use

Visit the app here: **[Used Vehicle Data Explorer](https://your-render-app-link.com)**

- Choose one or more years and manufacturers from the sidebar.
- View charts for odometer readings, price ranges, and average prices by model.
- Use insights to explore how vehicle condition and brand affect pricing.

## Dataset

The dataset includes car listings with information such as:
- Manufacturer  
- Model  
- Year  
- Odometer reading  
- Price  

It was originally provided during a prior project and reused here to expand on data app development and deployment skills.

## Project Goals

This project was designed to:
- Reinforce key data science skills (EDA, filtering, grouping, visualization)  
- Practice working with web app frameworks like Streamlit  
- Demonstrate deployment to a public cloud platform (Render)  
- Prepare a polished, interactive project for use in a professional portfolio

## Future Ideas

- Add predictive pricing models  
- Include more vehicle attributes (fuel type, color, region)  
- Improve layout and UX based on user feedback
